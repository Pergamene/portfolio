    bio: 'I’m a developer with a focus on web technologies.  I am detail-oriented in my approach and prioritize organized, clean, readable code.  I excel in planning and creating the logic of a program.  I’ve spent years teaching programming concepts to kids and can explain complex subjects in ways that are easy to understand.  I am constantly seeking ways to increase my understanding and to find ways to improve personally, as well as ways that can improve the products I am working on.',
