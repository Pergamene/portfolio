# [Personal Portfolio](https://www.austinkglenn.com)

My portfolio website to show some of my previous and current projects.

## Motivation
As a new web developer, I wanted to have a place to show off some of the cool projects I've worked on.  I also saw this as an opportunity to make a website that would showcase my skill as well, or better, than the projects on the site.

I also wanted to be able to show my design skills; both with the clean, minimalistic, approach of the site and by using a logo I designed.

## Tech Stack
###### React | HTML | CSS
The boilerplate was handled with `Create React App`, but I stipped down most of the code before starting.  I use `Material-UI` for the vector icons, as well as to apply the CSS to the React components.

## Featues
I wanted to include a dark mode on the site because it is becoming a highly requested feature and during my implementation of that I found a way to detect a users dark mode preferences (on devides that allow you to set a preference).  

If you're on a device that has that a dark mode setting try changing it and revisiting the site!
